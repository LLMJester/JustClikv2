## 📊 Overall Platform Completion: 5%

### ✅ **COMPLETED PHASES**

#### Phase 1: Basic File Setup (5%)
- [x] Created some config files locally
- [x] Got a Cohere API key
- [x] Generated some passwords
- [x] Made a subdomain that does nothing

---

## 🚧 **REALITY CHECK**

**NOTHING IS ACTUALLY WORKING:**
- ❌ No server
- ❌ No website 
- ❌ No AI assistant
- ❌ No mortgage platform
- ❌ Can't access anything at justinemortgagequeen.justclik.ai
- ❌ Basically just have some files sitting around

**STUCK ON:** CACloud ordering system requires domain registration, blocking server provisioning

---

## ⏳ **WHAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN**

#### Everything - Because Nothing Works Yet (95% remaining)
- [ ] Get server provisioned (BLOCKED)
- [ ] Install Docker and dependencies
- [ ] Deploy the actual application  
- [ ] Configure the AI assistant
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Optimize and secure platform
- [ ] Complete client handoff

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT PRIORITIES**
